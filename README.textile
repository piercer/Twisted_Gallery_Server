h2. Twisted Gallery Server

An experiment with MySQL stored procedures, Python and Twisted Networking. This is a content server that manages items in a hierarchical
tree which can be traversed/edited in a semi-restful manner.

It does not render the gallery, but instead returns XML for rendering as you wish.

Example URL's are

* /category/0  The top level category
* /collection/1  A collection of items
* /item/3 An item in a collection
* /item/3/50X50 If the item is an image then you can set the desired resolution of the returned image in the url

The system does have updating by POST requests - documentation for this will follow.

Needs at least MySQL 5.

h2. Preliminary Instructions (very basic and raw, might actually be wrong)

# Clone this repository
# Go to the database directory
# Import the tables and stored procedures
# Import the sample images using the ruby script
# Setup your config file correctly
# Start your server 'twistd -y TGDaemon.py'
# Look at http://localhost:<port>/category/0 to see the top level category, and then try some other url's
